# hello-world
Welcome to my Data Science bootcamp journey
I am a 4th year Economics students, with a major in Econometrics which is all about models and analysing data. i am passionate about anything that enables me to create, analyse/forececast or interpret a model or data. I see myself working as either a research analyst,
 business analyst or data analyst.
 With my Free time i read books or learn a skill, i recently learned how to do my makeup, i see it as a huge saving investment as i wont hire a makeup artist.
 I strongly believe in God, he is the architecture of our lives, however i also believe in hard work, In order for one to recieve God's blessings, one must work hard.
